# FNBO-Datathon-Challenge-2023
In the FNBO Datathon Challenge held in November 2023, me and my team worked on a dynamic team initiative aimed at transforming the customer experience for FNBO Bank. 

Leveraging Python, we conducted extensive data analysis, leading to the development of an interactive dashboard. This dashboard not only visualized crucial insights but also incorporated predictive models to anticipate customer engagement scores. 

Our data-centric approach provided actionable recommendations and during our presentation, we effectively communicated our innovative solutions, cementing our reputation as pioneers in the field of data-driven problem-solving.
